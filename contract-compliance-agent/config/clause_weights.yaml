# Clause Importance Weights
# =============================================================================
#
# Weights determine the relative importance of each clause category
# in the overall compliance score calculation.
#
# Weight values: 0.0 to 1.0
#   - 1.0  = Maximum importance (critical clause)
#   - 0.75 = High importance
#   - 0.5  = Medium importance
#   - 0.25 = Low importance
#   - 0.0  = Not scored (informational only)
#
# Weights are based on:
#   - CUAD benchmark category importance rankings
#   - ISO 37301 compliance risk assessments
#   - Industry best practices for contract review
#   - Legal expert input on common dispute areas

# =============================================================================
# Critical Clauses (Weight: 0.85 - 1.0)
# =============================================================================
# These clauses represent the highest risk areas and are essential
# for any commercial agreement.

weights:
  termination: 0.95
  # Rationale: Inability to exit agreements is a major business risk.
  # CUAD importance: High (frequently disputed)
  
  ip_assignment: 0.90
  # Rationale: IP ownership disputes are costly and common.
  # CUAD importance: High (critical in tech/creative contracts)
  
  liability_limitation: 0.90
  # Rationale: Uncapped liability can be existential risk.
  # CUAD importance: High (major negotiation point)
  
  indemnification: 0.85
  # Rationale: Third-party claims can exceed contract value.
  # CUAD importance: High (complex and frequently litigated)

# =============================================================================
# Important Clauses (Weight: 0.65 - 0.84)
# =============================================================================
# These clauses significantly impact risk profile and should be
# present in most agreements.

  confidentiality: 0.80
  # Rationale: Data protection increasingly important.
  # CUAD importance: High (especially post-GDPR)
  
  governing_law: 0.75
  # Rationale: Determines dispute resolution framework.
  # CUAD importance: Medium-High
  
  term: 0.70
  # Rationale: Duration clarity prevents misunderstandings.
  # CUAD importance: Medium
  
  payment: 0.70
  # Rationale: Payment disputes are common.
  # CUAD importance: Medium

# =============================================================================
# Standard Clauses (Weight: 0.40 - 0.64)
# =============================================================================
# These clauses are good practice but their absence is less risky.

  warranties: 0.60
  # Rationale: Important but often implied by law.
  # CUAD importance: Medium
  
  force_majeure: 0.55
  # Rationale: Increased importance post-pandemic.
  # CUAD importance: Medium (rising)
  
  assignment: 0.50
  # Rationale: Relevant for M&A scenarios.
  # CUAD importance: Medium
  
  non_compete: 0.50
  # Rationale: Context-dependent importance.
  # CUAD importance: Medium (varies by contract type)
  
  audit: 0.45
  # Rationale: Important for ongoing relationships.
  # CUAD importance: Low-Medium

# =============================================================================
# Boilerplate Clauses (Weight: 0.20 - 0.39)
# =============================================================================
# Standard provisions that are nice to have but rarely contentious.

  notices: 0.35
  # Rationale: Procedural, rarely disputed.
  # CUAD importance: Low
  
  entire_agreement: 0.30
  # Rationale: Standard boilerplate.
  # CUAD importance: Low
  
  severability: 0.25
  # Rationale: Standard protective language.
  # CUAD importance: Low
